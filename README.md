# Nashville_Housing_Analysis
This project analyzes residential housing sales data from Nashville to identify factors influencing property sale prices. Using R for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and ANOVA, the project highlights which property attributes (land value, building value, bedrooms, bathrooms, grades) have the strongest impact on housing.

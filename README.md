# Nashville_Housing_Analysis
This project analyzes residential housing sales data from Nashville to identify factors influencing property sale prices. Using R for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and ANOVA, the project highlights which property attributes (land value, building value, bedrooms, bathrooms, grades) have the strongest impact on housing prices.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw housing data (23,000+ records) to build a reliable dataset.  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis on housing attributes.  
- Estimate confidence intervals for average home sale prices.  
- Build multiple regression models to evaluate predictors of sale price.  
- Use ANOVA to test how features like bedrooms, full baths, and grade affect property values.  
- Provide insights into which features significantly increase or decrease property sale price.
